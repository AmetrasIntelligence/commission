This module allows to manage the following commission structure use case:

Agent A receives commission 50 when selling product 1 to customer X

Agent A receives commission 20 when selling product 1 to customer Y

This behavior is integrated with both pricelist-like Commission Type structure (sale_commission_product_criteria) and commission by discount (sale_commission_product_criteria_discount)
